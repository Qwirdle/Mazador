# Mazador

Mazador is a student management software/webapp that's designed to be more accessible and modern than the other outdated student management software that currently dominates the industry (PowerSchool has a special place in hell). Mazador is meant to be used in any grade level, including K-12 and higher education.

2. Open up the folder in any IDE.

5. Run the app.py file.

6. Open up any web browser and enter the following URL: http://localhost:5000/
